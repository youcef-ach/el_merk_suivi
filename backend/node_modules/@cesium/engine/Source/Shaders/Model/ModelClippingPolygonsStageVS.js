 * This vertex shader derives each vertex's UV coordinate within the model's clipping rectangle (its ellipsoid footprint).\n\
 * This UV is a normalized vec2, where [0,1] spans the rectangle. The fragment shader then compares each fragment's uv against the clipping polygons,\n\
 * whose positions live in the same uv space. See {@link ModelClippingPolygonsStageFS.glsl}.\n\
 *\n\
 * To get this uv, we need each vertex's geodetic (lon, lat), normalized against the model's rectangle.\n\
 * What makes this complicated is precision: we *cannot* use v_positionWC, because it only has 32-bit precision and is too large to be represented precisely.\n\
 * (Moreover, even representing v_positionWC with hi/lo components to emulate double precision, we could not perform the trig and other ops needed to derive lat/lon.)\n\
 * Instead, we use v_positionEC, and let {@link czm_eyeToCartographicDelta} compute a geodetic delta (long, lat) between the camera and vertex. This delta is a smaller quantity (and gets smaller and more precise as we zoom in).\n\
 * Then, we can combine this delta with the camera's own UV coordinate within the model's rectangle to obtain the vertex's uv coordinate.\n\
 *\n\
 * Ultimately, all this shader does is some geometry to obtain the vertex's relative position within the bounds of the model's geodetic rectangle.\n\
 * The complexity arises from doing so in a way that preserves precision.\n\
